• the first one is the original text line;
• the second one is the output code (possible tag scenarios);
• the third one is either the indication of error, either the suggestion for a correction;
The possible output codes (corresponding to the situation after the possible correction):
0 : line without tags
1 : the tags are well-formed, and they respect the open/closed tag sequence;
2 : the tags are well-formed and there are as many open tags as closed ones, but the open/closed sequence is not respected;
3 : the tags are well-formed but the number of the open/closed tags is not the same; 
4 : there is at least one potentially incorrect tag which could not be corrected."
